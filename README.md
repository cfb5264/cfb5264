### Hello!
I am Colin Brooks. I am a university senior majoring in Computer Science at The Pennsylvania State University.

This is my University account. I am required to keep all work done for classes private to prevent cheating. However, I can share my code with potential employers. You can shoot me an email at brookstco@gmail.com or my university email cfb5264@psu.edu, and I will send you the code.

My personal github account is [here](https://github.com/brookstco) if you'd like to see my programming outside of school projects, or actually use anything I've made.
