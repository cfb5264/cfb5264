### Hello!
I am Colin Brooks. I am a university senior majoring in Computer Science at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State).

This is my University account. I am required to keep all work done for classes private to prevent cheating. However, I can share my code with potential employers. You can send me an email at brookstco@gmail.com or my university email cfb5264@psu.edu, and I will send you the code.

My notable projects include a C implementation of Malloc, multithreading in C, a Python Lexer and Parser, and Python Tensorflow machine learning models using google colab. I also have a hard drive device driver that is several years old now, but still fairly complete, and am currently in a class that is doing iOS development using SwiftUI, but projects are probably not complete if it is still near the beginning of the semester. Next semester will have a class focusing on database design and management. 

My personal github account is [here](https://github.com/brookstco) if you'd like to see my programming outside of school projects.
